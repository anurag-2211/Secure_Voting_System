About the Project - 
The need for safe, transparent, and tamper-evident voting systems has increased dramatically in the modern digital age.  Traditional voting methods, such as paper ballots and computerized voting machines, are vulnerable to problems such as vote manipulation, illegal access, and security breaches.  To address these difficulties, the secured Voting System uses cryptographic techniques such as RSA and AES encryption to ensure the privacy, integrity, and safe transmission of all votes.  The method uses modern encryption techniques to ensure safe authentication and end-to-end vote protection, reducing the problems of traditional voting.
